# zmon-aws-agent
Use AWS API to retrieve "known" applications (currently expecting stups compatible userData for this)

Currently need to grant read only policy to EC2 instance for agent to walk over EC2/ELB instances.

Supply ENTITY_SERVICE_URL environment variable to docker image, pointing to zmon-data-service or zmon-controller, depending on your setup.

## Discovers
 * EC2 instances
 * RDS instances
 * Auto Scaling Groups
 * ELBs
 * DynamoDB tables
